# Start

In this repository, you'll find a variety of "exercises" that demonstrate the different ways you can automatically
migrate or upgrade an application to Spring Boot 3. The core technology behind each of these exercises
is [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite).

You do not need to complete all of these exercises. Instead, please pick the ones that are more interesting or relevant
to your needs.

Regardless of which exercise you pick, you will migrate an old version of
the [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)
repository to Spring Boot 3.
