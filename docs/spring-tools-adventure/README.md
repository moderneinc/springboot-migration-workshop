# Spring Tools Adventure

In this adventure, we are going to migrate an old version of a Spring (Maven) application to Spring Boot 3 using Visual
Studio.

## Prepare your environment

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Install the [Spring Tools 4 plugin](https://spring.io/tools)

3. Switch to Java 8 so you can properly build this repository and restart your Visual Studio. You might need to download
   Java 8 and update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If you are on a Unix-based system, we recommend
   using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/):

```shell
sdk install java VERSION_SDKMAN_JAVA8
sdk use java VERSION_SDKMAN_JAVA8
```

:::note
If you aren't on a Unix-based system or you don't want to install SDKMan, you'll need to install Java 8 and run
  something like:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=REPLACE_FOR_LOCATION_OF_JAVA_8
```
:::

4. Clone the [Spring PetClinic repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic
```

5. Check out the last Spring Boot 2.0 commit:

```shell
git checkout b527de52f5fd19f9fe550372c017d145a3b2a809
```

6. Make sure it runs on your machine:

```shell
./mvnw package -DskipTests
``` 

## Migrate to Spring Boot 3 using Spring Tools 4

Spring Tools 4 has OpenRewrite embedded into it.

Open the `spring-petclinic` repository with VS Code. You might see a pop-up in the bottom right saying that build tool
conflicts are detected. Make sure you select `Use Maven` or the next steps won't work:

Once the project builds and `Maven` is selected, you can open the `pom.xml` file and right-click anywhere in the file.
You should see two important options appear:

* Refactor Spring Boot Project
* Upgrade Spring Boot Version

For this adventure, let's click on `Upgrade Spring Boot Version`. The following dialog window should then appear:

:::note
If you don't see the above window and you get an error about `No Spring Boot` project being found, please try restarting
VS Code and select `Use Maven` in the popup that appears when VS Code loads.
:::

Select `VERSION_MIGRATE_SPRING_BOOT`. A progress message should appear at the bottom of VS Code. After the process
finishes, the changes won't be saved yet. You'll need to click on `File` > `Save All` to save all of the files and
preview the changes in Git:

```shell
git diff
```

:::note
This is a very recent feature that is only available for Maven projects and takes several minutes to execute. Only some
of the OpenRewrite migrations can be applied with this feature.

However, if you look at the results you should see that:

* The `@Autowired` annotation was removed
* JUnit 4 has been replaced with JUnit 5
* `javax` has been replaced with `jakarta`
* The code has been migrated to Java 17 and text blocks are used
* Some best practices are applied (such as adding the `public` test method modifier)
