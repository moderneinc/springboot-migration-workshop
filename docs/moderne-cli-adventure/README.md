# Moderne CLI Adventure

In this adventure, you will use the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro), a free tool that
allows developers to run OpenRewrite recipes without configuring any build plugin, to migrate a repository from Spring
Boot 2 to Spring Boot 3.

Afterwards, you'll use the CLI to publish your own OSS repository to the Moderne platform so that you can run recipes on
it without having to build it over and over.

## Prepare your environment

### Download and configure the Moderne CLI

1. Go to the [Moderne platform](https://app.moderne.io) and sign in.

2. Click on the `?` in the top right corner and then select `Moderne CLI` from the `Tools` menu:

   ![CLI download](assets/cli-download.png)

3. You can then either press the `Download Latest` button or install it directly through the command line by copying
   the `curl` command at the bottom of the modal:

   ![](assets/cli-download2.png)

4. Regardless of how you downloaded the CLI, you'll need to save it somewhere that your terminal can access. This could
   involve updating your `PATH` to point to a specific location or this could involve putting it in a directory that's
   already on your `PATH` such as a `/usr/bin` directory.

5. Ensure you can run the CLI by typing `mod help`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a list of
   commands:

   ![](assets/mod-cli.png)

6. Before you can run any commands, you'll need to create a Moderne Access Token. Go
   to https://app.moderne.io/settings/access-token, enter a name for the token, and press `generate`.

7. Once created, you should see a command that you can run to install the token on your system. Either run that command
   or export your token directly as an environment variable:

```shell
export MODERNE_ACCESS_TOKEN="mat-YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Configure the Spring PetClinic repository

With the CLI downloaded and configured, you're now ready to set up the repository.

1. Clone the [Spring PetClinic
   repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic
```

2. Check out the last Spring Boot 2.0 commit:

```shell
cd spring-petclinic
git checkout b527de52f5fd19f9fe550372c017d145a3b2a809
```

3. If you tried building this repository right now, you would more than likely run into errors. This is because this
   version of the Spring PetClinic repo requires Java 8. To ensure that everything builds correctly, you may need to
   download Java 8 and update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If you are on a Unix-based system, we recommend
   using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/):

      ```shell
      sdk install java 8.0.372-tem
      sdk use java 8.0.372-tem
      ```

* If you want to use `sdk` and the `java 8.0.372-tem` distribution is not available for you, select any distribution
  that represents a Java 8 version.

* If you aren't on a Unix-based system or you don't want to install SDKMan, you'll need to install Java 8 and run
  something like:

    ```shell
    export JAVA_HOME=REPLACE_FOR_LOCATION_OF_JAVA_8
    ```

4. With Java 8 configured, make sure that the Spring PetClinic repository builds on your machine:

```shell
./mvnw package -DskipTests
```

5. If everything has been set up correctly, you should see a `BUILD SUCCESS` message after the project is built and the
   tests passed.

## Migrate to Spring Boot 3 using the Moderne CLI

Now that the repository is configured, it's time to migrate it to Spring Boot 3 using the Moderne CLI.

1. Run the build command to generate the LST for the PetClinic repo:

```shell
mod build
```

2. Next, switch to Java 17 to run recipes. This is a requirement of the CLI:

```shell
sdk install java 17.0.7-tem
sdk use java 17.0.7-tem
```

OR

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=REPLACE_FOR_LOCATION_OF_JAVA_17
```

3. Kick off the recipe by running the following command from the
   `spring-petclinic` repository:

```shell
mod run --recipeName org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_0 --recipeGAVs rewrite-spring --skipBuild
```

4. The previous command should have updated your source files. Whenever you run a recipe, you should always double-check
   that the changes made match your expectations by running:

```shell
git diff
```

## Run a recipe on a remote LST

In the previous example, we used the Moderne CLI to run a recipe against a repository on your local machine. This is
fine when you only have one repository you're working with. However, what if you wanted to run a recipe against many
repositories at once? Checking them out locally, building each of them, and then running a separate run command for each
would take a considerable amount of time.

Fortunately, the run command can be extended so that you can run recipes against multiple repositories that have already
published their [Lossless Semantic Tree](https://docs.moderne.io/concepts/lossless-semantic-trees) (LST) artifacts.

This can be especially helpful when you're working on debugging a new recipe and want to test it against many
repositories at once.

For example, if you executed the following command,
the [Code Cleanup](https://app.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup) recipe would be run
against all of the Netflix repositories that have LST artifacts built in the Moderne platform:

```shell
mod run --repositories "github.com/Netflix/.+@main" --recipeName org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CodeCleanup --recipeGAVs rewrite-static-analysis
```

None of these repositories will be checked out locally and you won't have to wait for these repositories to build as the
pre-built artifacts will simply be downloaded to your machine instead.

Feel free to experiment with the run command by executing [any of our recipes](https://app.moderne.io/marketplace)
against any of the open-source Netflix repositories that exist in the Moderne platform.
