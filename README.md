# Springboot Migration Workshop

In this repository, you'll find a variety of "adventures" that demonstrate the
different ways you can automatically migrate or upgrade an application to Spring
Boot 3. The core technology behind each of these adventures is
[OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite).

You do not need to complete all of these adventures. Instead, please pick the
ones that are more interesting or relevant to your needs.

Regardless of which adventure you pick, you will migrate an old version of the
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)
repository to Spring Boot 3.

## Introduction

## Requirements

* Some basic Spring and Git knowledge and:
